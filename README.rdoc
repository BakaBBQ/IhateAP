== AP Computer Science Code Snippet

In case you are wondering, this is a code I wrote quite some years ago that shows my frustration of AP CS class,
to the point I think people are better off uploading code snippets and sharing them.

The code is extremely messy and... I was quite immature at the time. I did have a good experience practicing rails though.
